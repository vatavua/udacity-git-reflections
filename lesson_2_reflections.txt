What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a new repository is initialized, new .git directory is created. In other words necessary config/stats/ingo/description files are created for managing the new repository. We need to do it because otherwise git (as an application) would not be able to identify and manage our new project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area may be regarded as a temporary directory (cache) where new files are added. It allows us first to select the future files to our staging area, whithout creating each new unnecesary commits.
