What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a new repository is initialized, new .git directory is created. In other words necessary config/stats/ingo/description files are created for managing the new repository. We need to do it because otherwise git (as an application) would not be able to identify and manage our new project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area may be regarded as a temporary directory (cache) where new files are added. It allows us to incrementally add the new files and the to commit the changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area can be used to collect only those changes that describe the 'logical change', even there are more modified files. After that a new commit can be created. Tha opperation can be repeated if there is more tan one logical commit in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
The branches are helpful especially when we have to do some alternative experimental versions or when we want to implement different versions of the same project. The new branches can be used in parallel with the master branch and at some point in time they can be merged.
