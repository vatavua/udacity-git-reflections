When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When sharing the personal contribution with other friends or when I would like to make the project public.
- For a teacher, sometimes it's a good idea to initiate a public repository for students to collect all assessments, homework projects or to share new lessons and tutorials with students.
- For a startup project when there are more collaborators.
